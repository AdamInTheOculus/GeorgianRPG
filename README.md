# GeorgianRPG

This project is a collaboration of a bunch of Georgian College students. 
The majority of us are programmers but any students are welcome. We 
plan on writing a story t go with our game so we will need more than 
just programmers.

There are no specific rules for this group, other than joining our 
Facebook group to keep in contact with us.
