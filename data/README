This directory will contain various types of data to be used in our 
text-based game. Below is a list of the subdirectories and their 
purposes. If any sub-directories are added, they should be updated in 
this README so future students/participants will understand its purpose.

And if you don't like the formatting, you are free to edit it!

**********
** json **
**********
-- This directory will contain all JSON files used in our game. A JSON 
file can contain various types of data such as player stats, quest 
dialogues, weapon descriptions, map locations, etc.

***********
** error **
***********
-- This directory will contain any error dumps (text written by the 
programmer in the event that an error occurs). Each dump should contain 
the following:

1) Time of failure
2) Operating System information
3) General description of error

***********
** story **
***********
-- This directory will most likely contain text files of the game plot. 
It will also contain side-quest plots, perhaps even a more 
descriptive format for each quest. Only time will tell!
